- Amazon.com Inc, under pressure from an activist shareholder to disclose its policies on gender pay equality, said on Wednesday its female employees earned as much as their male counterparts,

Amazon, which estimates that women made up 39 percent of its global workforce and 24 percent of managers as of July, said a review of compensation including both base pay and stock compensation found that women earned 99.9 cents for every dollar that men earned in the same jobs.","title":"Amazon.com says its women workers paid as much as men","url":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-com-says-review-finds-171343291.html","symbol":"AMZN","source":"Yahoo","date":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 18:04:48 GMT","image":"http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/WFkFZsbIp4xDhxHAibZNPg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztpbD1wbGFuZTtxPTc1O3c9NjAw/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/images/US_AHTTP_REUTERS_OLUSTECH_WRAPPER_H_LIVE_NEW/2016-03-23T171343Z_1_LYNXNPEC2M1BN_RTROPTP_3_AMAZON-RESULTS_original.jpg"},{"description":null,"title":"Amazon.com says review finds women get equal pay at company","url":"http://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-com-says-review-finds-172912505.html","symbol":"AMZN","source":"Yahoo","date":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 17:29:12 GMT","image":"https://s1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/M7vS95b2fvSzHFeFStPk0A--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztxPTc1O3c9NjAw/http://l.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png"},{"description":null,"title":"The top 5 lingerie brands that aren't Victoria's Secret","url":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-5-lingerie-brands-arent-171524647.html","symbol":"AMZN","source":"Yahoo","date":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 17:27:00 GMT","image":"http://l1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/l2H2_cdXdioCOYtEDiIj8g--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztxPTc1O3c9NjAw/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/Finance/US_AFTP_SILICONALLEY_H_LIVE/The_top_5_lingerie_brands-dbbb506ca814c06fc767587d24e6482f.cf.png"},{"description":null,"title":"Here's Why Google Isn't Conceding the Cloud War to Amazon Just Yet","url":"http://www.thestreet.com/story/13505587/1/here-s-why-google-isn-t-conceding-the-cloud-war-to-amazon-just-yet.html?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO","symbol":"AMZN","source":"TheStreet.com","date":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 17:25:00 GMT","image":"http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/googlecalico_600x400.jpg"},{"description":"[Reuters] - Online retailer Amazon.com Inc said on Wednesday a recent survey of its employees found that female workers earned 99.9 cents for every dollar earned by men in the same positions last year.

In Oklahoma and Texas, workers are delaying retirement plans, surrendering trucks, cars and land in personal bankruptcy cases, or just praying oil prices will recover.","title":"Ride to the Bottom: US energy workers hit hard by company stock bets","url":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/ride-bottom-us-energy-workers-050001260.html","symbol":"CVX","source":"Yahoo","date":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 05:00:01 GMT","image":"http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/M7vS95b2fvSzHFeFStPk0A--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztxPTc1O3c9NjAw/http://l.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png"},{"description":null,"title":"Chevron's First Gorgon Development LNG Cargo Dispatched","url":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevrons-first-gorgon-development-lng-194007829.html","symbol":"CVX","source":"Yahoo","date":"Mon, 21 Mar 2016 19:40:07 GMT","image":"http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/M7vS95b2fvSzHFeFStPk0A--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztxPTc1O3c9NjAw/http://l.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png"},{"description":null,"title":"Disney Will Stop Filming in Georgia if Gov.
