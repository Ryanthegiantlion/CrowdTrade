We Fools may not all hold the same opinions, but we all believe that <a href=\"http://wiki.fool.com/Motley\">considering a diverse range of insights</a> makes us better investors. The Motley Fool has a <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/Legal/fool-disclosure-policy.aspx\">disclosure policy</a>.</em><p><strong>Apple </strong>(NASDAQ: AAPL) finally went ahead and launched its widely anticipated 4-inch iPhone refresh dubbed the iPhone SE. The device is pretty much what everyone expected it to be; it combines the processing power, memory, and iSight cameras from the iPhone 6s, the wireless subsystem of the iPhone 6, and the external casing and display lifted from venerable iPhone 5s.</p><p>The \"bold\" and \"risky\" part of all of this is that Apple is offering the variant with 16 gigabytes of storage for just $399 and will sell customers one with a full 64 gigabytes of storage for $499. This has a very interesting implication.</p><p><strong>Apple is basically selling a better phone than the iPhone 6/6 Plus for less<br></strong> On the inside, arguably where it counts, the iPhone SE is a substantially better smartphone than either the iPhone 6 or the 6 Plus. It has significantly more processing power, packs in more memory, and contains a higher-resolution rear-facing camera.</p><p>Where the iPhone 6/6 Plus excel over the iPhone SE are the following:</p><ul><li>Display quality: The iPhone 6/6 Plus use higher resolution displays with superior viewing angles and contrast ratio.</li>\t<li>Display size: The iPhone 6/6 Plus offer significantly more screen real estate than does the iPhone SE.</li>\t<li>Industrial design: The iPhone 6/6 Plus are thinner and arguably more \"modern\" looking designs.</li></ul><p>Although many potential customers probably pay more attention to the above external/cosmetic features rather than on the processing power and features on the inside, a non-trivial portion of the iPhone-buying population will appreciate the relative value that the iPhone SE brings to the table specification-wise.</p><p>Apple may cannibalize, perhaps to a material degree, its older generation iPhone 6/6 Plus phones in the six month period or so that they occupy Apple's \"mid-tier.\" </p><p><strong>An attempt to try to juice iPhone sales with a \"value\" product<br></strong> The last time that Apple tried to launch a \"value\" product -- the iPhone 5c -- the device reportedly didn't do as well as the company had expected. Conversely, sales of the premium iPhone 5s performed better than expected, leading supply constraints in the company's first quarter of fiscal 2014 .</p><p>However, it's worth noting a couple of pretty significant differences between the iPhone 5c in late 2013 and the iPhone SE in early 2016.</p><p>First of all, the iPhone 5c packaged up the prior generation's internal components and camera subsystems in a less-premium plastic shell. Remember back then one of the key selling points of Apple's phones is that they were made out of aluminum and had a premium look and feel as a result.</p><p>The iPhone SE stands in stark contrast to the iPhone 5c. It comes in a nice metal casing, features top-of-the-line internal components, implements the same camera that the flagship iPhone 6s has, and comes with support for Apple Pay.</p><p>The iPhone SE also <em>starts </em>at $399 for the 16 gigabyte model and goes to $499 for the decked-out 64 gigabyte model. The iPhone 5c started life at $549 for the 16 gigabyte variant and went to $649 for the 32 gigabyte version.</p><p>The iPhone SE clearly provides a much better relative value to both Apple's own flagship products than the 5c did (some would, perhaps, argue that it's <em>too </em>close) and to the competition. Even with a small, fairly old display, the Apple A9 is arguably the most powerful mobile system-on-chip in the market today.</p><p><strong>Apple has a good product here <br></strong>I believe that the iPhone SE looks like a solid product that offers a tremendous amount of value for the money, especially relative to other members of the iPhone lineup. This looks like a great product with which to lure out folks in mature markets that simply don't want a larger iPhone as well as a solid tool with which to try to gain share in potentially more price-sensitive emerging markets.</p><p>The main risk that I see here is that Apple could very well see a substitution of sales of higher priced/higher margin iPhone 6/6 Plus phones in favor of the iPhone SE. </p><p>I plan to place an order for one as soon as it becomes available and hope to have a full review of the device published in early April. Stay tuned!</p><div><p><strong>3 companies poised to explode when cable dies</strong> <br>Cable is dying. And there are 3 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering $2.2 trillion industry finally bites the dust.

Turnover for the year amounted to HK$123,561,000 representing a decrease of around 62.1% as compared with last year, primarily due to the suspension of the sales of lottery tickets with effect from March 2015. Income from tele-media business amounted to HK$96,338,000 representing an increase of around 15% as compared with last year. The profit attributable to the owners of the Company amounted to HK$142,666,000, as compared with a loss of HK$131,590,000 last year. </p><p>Lottery-related Business</p><p>The main source of income for V1 Group's lottery-related business derives from the websites set up and operated by the partners of the Group, including Lottery 365, a strategic cooperative mobile application developed by the business partner of the Group, \"Zhongguozucaiwang\"(www.zgzcw.com) and \"Diyicai\"(www.diyicai.com). Such commercial cooperation also resulted in relevant income structure. </p><p>Income from lottery-related business amounted to HK$27,223,000, representing a decrease of around 88.8% as compared with the corresponding period last year. Segment loss for the whole year was HK$45,604,000 (2014: profit of HK$78,964,000). The unsatisfactory result for the period was mainly attributable to the adverse effects of the suspension of the operations of online sale of paperless lottery tickets and sale of lottery tickets through mobile phones of the Group's business partners in Mainland China with effect from 1 March 2015. Accordingly, the Group's lottery-related business has been suspended simultaneously. It is uncertain when the operation of the Group's lottery-related business will resume.</p><p>The Group's business partners will observe and comply with any new rules and regulations promulgated by the relevant PRC regulatory authorities and make adjustments to their operations of online sale of lottery tickets and sale of lottery tickets through mobile phones where necessary. The Group will actively cooperate with its business partners with an aim to have lottery-related business of the Group back on the track as soon as possible.</p><p>In early 2015, the monthly lottery sales at Zhonguozucaiwang and Lottery 365 reached another historical high, stimulated by the Asian Cup and game bets on fixed single matches. In March 2015, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the General Administration of Sport of the PRC jointly promulgated the Notice on Issues Regarding Conducting Self-examination and Self-correction Activities of the Unauthorized Sale of Lottery through Internet, leading to the full suspension of internet sale of lottery tickets.</p><p>Thus, the Chinese internet lottery industry is facing the fifth time of rectification, and again the entire industry entered into a period of confusion on development. During the rectification period, the lottery-related business partners of V1 Group decided to develop through three main aspects, including \"Information and Data\", \"Game Entertainment and Value-added Services\" and \"Innovative Service Models\", exploring an efficient operating approach to boost user activity.</p><p>The website of Diyicai has undertaken an upgrade project, in order to enhance users loyalty and activity towards the website of the Group's lottery-related business. It is mainly focusing on the innovation on presenting lottery results, we are the first to present lottery results in forms of graphs, enabling the users to search for all kinds of lottery information such as the dividends, lottery pools and sales conveniently. Meanwhile, we have improved the user experience with a new website interface by modifying various interface designs such as the information modules, odds centers and real-time scores with respect to the website style and the channel features on website.</p><p>In April 2015, Zhongguozucaiwang launched a \"Lottery Information\" channel and its brand-new HTML5 version, with a precise focus on seven key matches, namely, \"Five European League Matches\", \"UEFA Champions League\", \"AFC Champions League\", \"Copa America\", \"FIFA Women's World Cup\", \"UEFA Euro Qualifying tournament\", and \"Chinese Football Association Super League\". The website has concentrated its resources on building a leading matches center of the industry and rolled out special features, schedule points, key rivals and matches analysis for important matches, with full coverage of the homepage search results of three main search engines - Baidu, 360 and Sogou.

The two websites lead the industry in terms of the speed and accuracy of real-time scores and odds changes, substantially enhancing the user experience of information access.</p><p>In May 2015, Zhongguozucaiwang and Diyicai saw a full recovery of their pageviews; in June 2015, the pageviews of both websites surpassed the record prior to the sales suspension. \"Information and Data\" played a key role in retaining users and maintaining user activity for the two websites.</p><p>In respect of game entertainment, Lottery 365 successively launched two main guessing games \"Guessing PK Game\" and \"Virtual Guessing of Football Game\", provide users with a chance of winning cash and prizes. Besides, \"Racetrack\", a Lottery 365's self-developed high frequency game is very popular among users, during the first week of its launch, its simultaneous users reached more than ten thousand.</p><p>In respect of innovative service model, the Group's lottery-related business partner has collaborated with \"Football\" newspaper, No.1 professional print media of sports in China, together with other business partners jointly roll out a platform for paid expert recommendations.

Sheridan sees several \"key weaknesses\" in Groupon's competitive position, including marketing spend that will pressure near-term margins, rising competition, a shift to lower-margin business and slowing customer and engagement growth.</p><p>Sheridan blamed those troubles on Groupon's international retrenchment and its \"lack of operating profit scale to drive additional investments in innovation that might counteract the platform strength of Google and Facebook.\"</p><p>Groupon's changes come as others are also tweaking their strategies.</p><p>Last week, <strong>Angie's List</strong> ( <a href=\"http://www.investors.com/news/technology/groupon-could-get-more-users-from-facebook-in-new-social-media-push/\">ANGI</a>) got a revenue outlook boost from Pacific Crest Securities, which praised the online review site's <a href=\"http://www.investors.com/news/technology/millennials-prompt-angies-list-to-tear-down-paywalls-go-free-ceo/\">recent decision to drop</a> its current membership model and replace it with free access to its business ratings and reviews as part of a tiered subscription plan.</p><p>The addition of the free tier \"should reignite user growth,\" wrote Pacific Crest analyst Evan Wilson in a research report last week.</p></div>",

Howard Schultz, chairman and ceo of Starbucks, honored the accomplishments of the company in delivering record financial results and introduced the company's next level of social impact initiatives.</p><p>\"There are very few consumer brands in the world - products or experiences - that have created both an undeniable customer attachment to the brand while also seeing universal acceptance. And, we take none of that for granted. We have to earn it every day,\" said Howard Schultz, chairman and ceo of Starbucks Corporation. \"In addition to earning our customers' trust and respect, we also cannot be a bystander at a time in our nation's history when government gridlock, economic disparity and partisan polarization continue to stunt our progress. In our view, the private sector must contribute more as an economic and social force in partnership with all other sectors.\"</p><p><b>FY15 Financial Highlights/ Achievements</b></p><p>Starbucks highlighted the interdependence of business success with driving social impact at scale and cited Starbucks record revenues of $19.2 billion (17 percent growth over FY14) and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.58 <sup>1</sup> (19 percent growth on a non-GAAP basis <sup>1</sup>) in fiscal 2015; $3.7 billion in non-GAAP operating income <sup>2</sup> (19 percent growth on a non-GAAP basis <sup>2</sup>) in fiscal 2015; and $2.4 billion returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Starbucks also invested $284 million in healthcare benefits and $167 million in <i>Bean Stock</i> in FY15.</p><p><b>Starbucks Growth Agenda Outlined Across Geographies and Disciplines</b></p><p>Kevin Johnson, president and chief operating officer, highlighted Starbucks approach to elevating the brand across retail, channel development and digital through new innovation, reaching new customers and creating new occasions for customer visits. Johnson highlighted the company's growth ambitions across the Americas, EMEA and China/Asia Pacific in retail, digital and channel development.</p><p>Building on the success of the Teavana brand in Starbucks channels in the U.S. and Canada, Johnson unveiled the company's plans to extend the Teavana brand into Starbucks retail stores across EMEA and China/Asia Pacific by the end of the fiscal year. Tea has grown by 17 percent over the prior year with all tea categories posting strong growth, led by iced tea at 29 percent.</p><p>\"Our focus on connecting with customers and delivering experiences across our retail, channel development, and digital businesses, continues to elevate the Starbucks brand,\" said Kevin Johnson, president and chief operating officer of Starbucks. \"This is a tribute to the 300,000 people who proudly wear the Green Apron and serve customers in 70 countries around the world. This focus and hard work has enabled us to deliver record results and significant value for our shareholders.\"</p><p><b>Starbucks Cementing its Global Leadership Role in Single Serve Coffee and Ready to Drink Beverages</b></p><p>By bringing the <i>Starbucks Experience</i> to customers outside its retail stores in a brand accretive way, Starbucks Channel Development continues to demonstrate industry leading growth with $1.7 Billion in revenue in FY15 and 17.4 percent growth in operating income. \"We are elevating Starbucks by taking inspiration from our stores and bringing high quality, innovative products to our customers around the world,\" said Michael Conway, president, Global Channel Development from the stage at today's meeting. Two key announcements were shared during Conway's remarks. The first being the launch of Starbucks Ready to Drink Cold Brew Coffee in the U.S. through the North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo. This premium, smooth tasting coffee delivers craft cold brew on the go and will be introduced this summer. The second was Starbucks commitment to strengthening its global leadership position in the nearly $8 Billion premium single cup coffee category. This will come to life through an updated agreement with Keurig Green Mountain to continue to be the supplier of Starbucks K-cup pods. The companies updated their agreement to provide greater flexibility in driving product innovation and more control over quick and deep expansion of our products into channels beyond grocery. Additionally, this summer in the U.S., Starbucks will launch an entirely new beverage line for the Keurig hot system - the Starbucks Latte which will include customer favorites including Caramel, Mocha and Vanilla Latte. Lastly, this summer in Europe, Starbucks will launch espresso capsules which are compatible with Nespresso&#174;* machines which will be sold first in UK and France through sales in Starbucks retail stores, grocery and online.</p><p><b>New Game-Changing Advances in Digital Customer Experience - With Loyalty at the Core</b></p><p>Also on stage, Johnson presented the growth of the company's strategic digital flywheel of platforms. At the core of Starbucks digital ecosystem is loyalty. In February, Starbucks unveiled changes to its loyalty program which created a level playing field for Starbucks customers to earn 2 stars for every dollar spent. Since that announcement, more than 500,000 customers signed up for Starbucks Rewards. In addition, total active members of Starbucks Rewards are now reaching more than 12 million members in the U.S., up 1 million over the past quarter. The new program will go into effect on April 12.</p><p>This evolution also allows Starbucks the ability to create new ways for customers to engage in the program outside of Starbucks. Last October, Starbucks announced that Chase Commerce Solutions replaced Square as its payments processor. And recently, Starbucks entered into a payments agreement to accept Chase Pay. Today, Starbucks expands this partnership with the announcement of a new product called the Starbucks Rewards Prepaid Card from Chase.</p><p>Available by the end of this year, the Starbucks Rewards Prepaid Card is a reloadable prepaid card that allows customers to earn stars for all card purchases made virtually anywhere that Visa is accepted. Customers will be able to apply for the Starbucks Rewards Prepaid Card through the Starbucks Mobile App or Starbucks.com. This new model is just the beginning of Starbucks opening up its digital ecosystem as well as extending its payment platform.</p><p><b>Creating Social Impact/Building a Purpose-Driven Workforce</b></p><p>Starbucks partners represent diverse views, backgrounds, experiences and ideas, creating a culture of people unified in an aspiration to make a positive difference both in and outside of stores. At recent Partner Open Forums, in direct conversations, and across social platforms, Starbucks partners have voiced their aspirations as global citizens, asking the company to engage on important societal issues and participate in their communities and countries. Today, Starbucks is making three specific commitments in collaboration with leading institutions in an effort to help find solutions to complex societal problems and to create long term impact and sustainability.</p><p></p><ul><li><b>Starbucks Teams Up with Democracy Works to launch TurboVote Challenge:</b> Building upon its demonstrated track record of joining like-minded organizations to create meaningful social impact at scale, Starbucks will support the non-profit<a href=\"http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdemocracy.works%2F&amp;esheet=51306084&amp;newsitemid=20160323006248&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Democracy+Works&amp;index=1&amp;md5=de5dcf3fd49711d2214f5fa43ba8b9f2\">Democracy Works</a> and its <a href=\"http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdemocracy.works%2Fturbovote%2F&amp;esheet=51306084&amp;newsitemid=20160323006248&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=TurboVote+project&amp;index=2&amp;md5=91f4d440df3566691ac2522914a1e4f4\">TurboVote project</a> to strengthen democracy and elevate citizenship in America<i>.</i> In the \"<a href=\"http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdemocracy.works%2F&amp;esheet=51306084&amp;newsitemid=20160323006248&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=TurboVote+Challenge%2C%E2%80%9D&amp;index=3&amp;md5=2914e4aceaca4d5627a32f35c8b0c40e\">TurboVote Challenge,\"</a> Starbucks will be joined by Airbnb, Arizona State University, Fusion, Lyft, Mic, Spotify, Target, theSkimm, Univision, The Video Game Voters Network, Westfield Corporation, WeWork and others in an effort to engage 80 percent of all eligible voters to participate in our democracy by 2020.

As part of that ongoing commitment and Starbucks comprehensive approach to ethical sourcing, Starbucks today announced that its highly successful, One Tree for Every Bag program is on track to donate 20 million rust resistant coffee tree seedlings to farmers in need by the end of the year. Designed to engage its customers in understanding more about where their coffee comes from, and offering a new way to scale farmer support, this program donates a coffee tree for every bag of coffee purchased in the U.S. through its partnership with Conservation International**. With many coffee growing regions around the world feeling the impact of coffee rust on their quality and supply of<i>arabica</i> coffee, this becomes a critical element in ensuring the longevity of the industry. In addition to the millions of pounds of green coffee this program will help farmers grow - helping to create economic stability for their communities and families - the development of seedling nurseries and a delivery infrastructure with supplier ECOM for the initiative will generate more than 1,600 jobs in the process. An initial 11 million rust resistant coffee seedlings will begin to be distributed in Guatemala, Mexico and El Salvador in May ahead of planting season in each of these countries. All of this work will be supported by Starbucks open sourced ethical sourcing program, C.A.F.E Practices, which offers agronomy information and tools in addition to financing for farmers worldwide in collaboration with Conservation International.</li>\t<li><b>Starbucks FoodShare - Hunger Relief in Action</b>: Starbucks is leading a national effort to provide nourishing, ready-to-eat meals to people in need with Starbucks FoodShare. Through a new and unique strategic alliance with Feeding America, Starbucks has set a goal to rescue 100% of food available to donate from its more than 7,000 U.S. stores. Working together, Starbucks will bring ready-to-eat, nourishing meals to scale for the millions who are in need, including breakfast sandwiches, Paninis, Bistro Boxes and salads. True to Starbucks mission to \"act with courage, challenge the status quo and find new ways to grow our company and each other,\" Starbucks partners advocated for a solution to donate unsold food and distribute it to those in need. In response to this call for action, Starbucks invested in research and quality assurance testing to develop a program to safely donate ready-to-eat meals to the 1 in 7 Americans who may not know where they will find their next meal. By this time next year, Starbucks hopes that partners in its U.S. company-operated stores will be able to add 5 million meals to the pastries they already donate today. And in the next five years, Starbucks will build on this commitment by engaging other companies and organizations to help end hunger with its strategic partner, Feeding America, the nation's largest domestic hunger-relief organization, and its nationwide network of food banks.</li></ul><p>Starbucks Annual Meeting of Shareholders began at 10 a.m. PT today, and will be webcast and can be accessed at <a href=\"http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.starbucks.com&amp;esheet=51306084&amp;newsitemid=20160323006248&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.starbucks.com&amp;index=6&amp;md5=6969e86b3e5657ac3695ea0d672d8fa4\">http://investor.starbucks.com</a>.
