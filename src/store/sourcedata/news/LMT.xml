The issue caused sensors to restart once every four hours of flying due to the timing of software messages from the sensors to the main F-35 fusion computer and the aim was to improve this to one in every eight to 10 flying hours, the statement said. Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon&apos;s chief weapons tester, said the program would not be ready for operational testing until mid-2018, a year later than expected, due to delays in completion of the jet&apos;s software and other issues.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/3208721013</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2016 16:19:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>U.S. Showcases Commitment to Maritime Defense and Security Partnerships, Investment in Middle East/North Africa at DIMDEX 2016</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-showcases-commitment-maritime-defense-150000489.html</link><description>[PR Newswire] - DOHA, Qatar and WALDWICK, N.J., March 23, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- When DIMDEX 2016 opens in Doha on March 29, the United States will be among the event&apos;s largest international exhibitors.

(LMT) told me at its 2016 Media Day Tuesday that it continues to be “very focused” on its Information Systems &amp; Global Solutions business despite the fact that by the end of the year it will be sold off to Leidos Holdings Inc. (LDOS) And nowhere else has this seemed more evident than in the government service unit’s Department of Veterans Affairs IT work. Leidos wanted to bring IS&amp;GS on board partly because it felt these health care IT capabilities complemented its already-deep portfolio at the Defense Health Agency. Integral to the VA work is a crucial acquisition Lockheed made in December 2014 of Systems Made Simple.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/545693552</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2016 10:30:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Lockheed sharpens its energy-tech efforts</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/external/xusatoday/rss/SIG=13e6bdaud/*http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/2016/03/20/lockheed-sharpens-its-energy-tech-efforts/81966366/</link><description></description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/76275807</guid><pubDate>Sun, 20 Mar 2016 11:30:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Can Orbital ATK Turn Old Satellites Into New Money?</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/external/mfool/rss/SIG=13arehqol/*http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/03/19/can-orbital-atk-turn-old-satellites-into-new-money.aspx?source=yahoo-2&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=yahoo-2</link><description></description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/1823783780</guid><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2016 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Jeff Bezos Unveils His Grand Plan to Conquer Space</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/external/mfool/rss/SIG=13aaoq8ju/*http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/03/19/jeff-bezos-unveils-his-grand-plan-to-conquer-space.aspx?source=yahoo-2&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=yahoo-2</link><description></description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/473297863</guid><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2016 14:13:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>U.S. Navy missile program uses first 3D printed component</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-navy-missile-program-uses-173602594.html</link><description>[Reuters] - A U.S Navy ballistic missile program used its first component made from 3D printing, a process that sharply reduces the manufacturing time, according to the weapons&apos; producer, Lockheed Martin Corp.
