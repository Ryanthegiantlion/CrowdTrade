Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon's chief weapons tester, said the program would not be ready for operational testing until mid-2018, a year later than expected, due to delays in completion of the jet's software and other issues.", "guid": {"@isPermaLink": "false", "#text": "yahoo_finance/3208721013"}, "pubDate": "Wed, 23 Mar 2016 16:19:55 GMT"}, {"title": "U.S. Showcases Commitment to Maritime Defense and Security Partnerships, Investment in Middle East/North Africa at DIMDEX 2016", "link": "http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-showcases-commitment-maritime-defense-150000489.html", "description": "[PR Newswire] - DOHA, Qatar and WALDWICK, N.J., March 23, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- When DIMDEX 2016 opens in Doha on March 29, the United States will be among the event's largest international exhibitors.
